# Agent-Based Model for Internship Opportunities in Sri Lanka

## Overview
This project implements an Agent-Based Model (ABM) using NetLogo to address the gap in internship opportunities for IT undergraduates in Sri Lanka. The model simulates interactions among students, universities, and companies to analyze factors influencing placements and explores strategies to bridge the gap.

## Features
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Models interactions between students, universities, and companies.
- **Customizable Agents**: Define agents with attributes like GPA, skills, and hiring preferences.
- **Policy Analysis**: Simulate the impact of interventions like skill development and financial incentives for SMEs.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Track placement metrics, skill evolution, and market dynamics.

## Technologies Used
- **NetLogo**: A platform for building and visualizing agent-based models.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the NetLogo file (`internship_model.nlogo`) in the NetLogo application.
3. Adjust simulation parameters (e.g., skill levels, hiring criteria) using the interactive interface.
4. Run the simulation and observe the results through the built-in graphs and metrics.

## Insights
- Highlights disparities in internship opportunities between private and government university students.
- Demonstrates how adaptive behavior, such as skill improvement and flexible hiring criteria, reduces the gap.
- Offers actionable strategies for policymakers, universities, and companies.
